    <h1>Nathaniel King</h1>
    <h2>1992 - 2021</h2>
    <h3>Cult Leader</h3>
    <p>A malevolent spirit filled with angst. Heartbreak, regret, anger, betrayal... You name it, he probably has an emotion fueled by trauma backing it up. Forced to live a life he never wanted and then killed off by the lover who made him do it, he has to deal with the outcome of those life choices. A cruel fate for one manipulated by a pretty face. He's aware of all the terrible things he's done in her name and isn't against receiving his punishment, expecting to go anywhere but up.

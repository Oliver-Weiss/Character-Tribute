# Character-Tribute
This project was created for the purpose of practicing basic HTML and CSS. It's a mock tribute page created of a character I own and everything published is purely fictional. This is a static page to test how GitHub deployment works.

In order to use this code, go to "Code" and select the "Download ZIP" dropdown. Unzip the files somewhere you can find them (preferably in a new folder). You can then open the files in a text editor like Visual Studio Code and edit it to fit your own needs.
